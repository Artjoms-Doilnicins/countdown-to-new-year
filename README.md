# Countdown to New Year 2025

A simple countdown timer that dynamically updates the time remaining until New Year 2025. It calculates and displays the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds left in real-time.

## Features

### CSS

- A flexible layout created with `flexbox` for the central alignment of elements.
- Customizable color themes via CSS variables (`--color`).
- Text styling includes shadows for better readability.

### JavaScript

#### Countdown Logic: 

- Calculates the time gap between the current date and New Year 2025.

- Converts the gap into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
 
- Updates the DOM elements every second using `setTimeout`.

## How It Works 

1. The script calculates the time difference between the current time and New Year 2025.

2. The difference is divided into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

3. The timer updates every second to display the current countdown.
